# Supply-Chain-Buddy
Supply Chain Buddy is an open-source order management app for companies to manage their supply chains. It allows buyers and suppliers to collaborate within one system to improve information visibility, efficiency and accuracy over supply chain.

## Motivation
Most of time, after a purchase order is issued by a customer to a supplier, the follow-up and update of subsequent order delivery would depend on emails or phone calls. Such communication method is not organized and could be time consuming. For example, one day my supplier called me that there is a certain change on the delivery of my order, I take a note of this info and some days later, then things got busy and I accidently lost the note then I would have to call my supplier again to get clarification if I could remember that. We know that companies have their own internal systems to manage orders and inventory. What if there is a shared order management system that allow access for people from both sides of supply chain? Then wouldn’t that create a more collaborative environment? That idea inspired me to make this app — Supply Chain Buddy. The idea of this app is to maintain updated, accurate and organized information for order management and provide insightful information through data visulization of purchase order history.
